# Birb Boids
A simple Unity application playing around with the consept or "Boids" first developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. 
The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object.
The concept is also sometimes referred to as "flocking".

It uses three simple concepts to simulate intelligent life forms:
- separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
